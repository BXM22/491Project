This exercise is particularly beneficial for athletes, like wrestlers or boxers, who require strong neck muscles, but it can also be beneficial for office workers or anyone prone to neck strain due to prolonged periods of sitting or looking at screens. Incorporating Cable Seated Neck Extensions into a workout routine can help enhance overall neck strength and flexibility, potentially improving performance in sports and daily activities, and reducing discomfort associated with poor posture.",

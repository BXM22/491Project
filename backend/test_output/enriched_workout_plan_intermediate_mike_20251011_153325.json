Avoid gripping the dumbbell too tightly as this can lead to unnecessary forearm fatigue.",

Avoid the common mistake of using momentum to lift the weight, as this can lead to muscle strain and doesn't effectively engage the targeted muscles. At the top of the movement, your arm should be fully extended but not locked out.\n\n4"
